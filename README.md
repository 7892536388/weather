## FAQ:

<i>Q - I found a bug and I can't (or donâ€™t want to) fix it, how can I add it to the issues list?</i>

<b>A - Check the issues list and see if it already has that bug. If not, submit a new issue with the "bug" label</b>

<i>Q - I found a bug and I want to fix it, is it ok if I just do that and make a pull request?</i>
  
<b>A - No, it's not ok. Before attempting to do any work it is highly recommended that you check with the current issues list. It might happen, that there is already a similar issue, and even someone already working on it (assigned to it).</b>
  
<i>Q - There is no issue for the bug that I found and want to fix, what should I do?</i>
  
<b>A - It is recommended that you submit a new issue, get that issue assigned on you, and then work on it. However, if the amount of expected work is relatively small (< 1 day), you can simply fix the bug and make a pull request right away.</b> <i>P.S: Sometimes your name might not appear in the assignee list, hence you might not get assigned, yet a confirmation message from OP is enough in most cases.</i>

<i>Q - I want to work on an issue, can I work on it right away?</i>

<b>A - It's recommended that you leave a comment below that issue, and ask the community to assign it to you.</b>
